## :books: Analysis - Part I

#### ‚ñ™ Perform FEM analysis on your mesh.
In this part of the Homework we use a mesh of quadrilateral elements with a vicinity about 0.5 mm in the hole and 2mm elsewhere, because we want it to be more specific with better results in the hole that our structure has. We notice that as we use a 2D geometrical blase-plate, we were able to use the same method as in CST element that we used in Homework 2 but for Quad4 based on the Chapter 17 of Felippa's book.   <br>

So we use the FEM recipe seen in class for each Quad element in the structure.

<br>
To complete the analysis, the quad4.py programming was carried out in classes where gauss quadrature is applied, which is a method of approximation of a definite integral. Where B is the constant deformation-displacement matrix and b is the vector with the internal forces of the body, while wi and wj come from the gauss quadrature obtain by applying the 1D Gauss rules to each independent variable in turn.
<br>

#### ‚ñ™ Visualize displacements and stress in the center of each element (one per element as in the CST element). 
To be able to visualize the displacements and stresses in the elements, we use the code present in the gmsh_post to write the displacement data obtain when we applied the direct stiffness method and for the compute of the stresses we used the function quad4_post that can be found in the quad4.py 
<br>


#### ‚ñ™ Use the readme to display the deformed shape and stress components for a force F = 1 KN.  
Using the same method we can display the deformed shape and stresses for the structure with a force of 1 kN in the x-direction.

#### ‚ñ™ Stress Recovery 
The elemental nodal point stresses are located on the corners and possibly midpoints of the element, they can be compute at the nodal point from adjacent elements will not generally be the same, because they are not required to be continuous in displacements. <br>
From Chapter 28 of Felippa's Book we know that are two approaches for the to study the recovery of stress values for 2D plane-stress elements. They are: 
<br>
<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ *Direct evaluation of the stresses*, where we substitute the natural coordinates of the nodal points as       arguments to the shape function modules. The equations used are presented below. <br>
    **Strains** <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?e&space;=&space;B\cdot&space;u^{e}" title="e = B\cdot u^{e}" /> <br>
    **Stresses** <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\sigma&space;=&space;E\cdot&space;e&space;=&space;E\cdot&space;B\cdot&space;u^{e}" title="\sigma = E\cdot e = E\cdot B\cdot u^{e}" />
    <br>
   Where u_e is the vector of computed element node displacement and B is the strain-displacement matrix assembled        with the x and y derivatives of the element shape functions evaluated at the point where the element is. 
<br>
<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ *Gauss integration points*, where we use the element stiffness integration rule and then extrapolate to the element node points. This approach gives better stress values for quadrilateral elements, so we use this method.
<br>

#### ‚ñ™ Implementation of nodal stress averaging 
To understand the extrapolation procedure, it is convenient to consider that the region enclosed by the Gaussian points are the internal elements. So the Gauss element (e ‚Äô) is a quadrilateral with four nodes, where its natural quadrilateral coordinates are denoted Œæ‚Äô and Œ∑ ‚Äô. Which are related to Œæ and Œ∑ with the following relations.
<br>
So we create a function called **nodal_stress_averaging** in out *quad4.py* file, where the inputs are xy, u_e, properties and the vector of the stresses calculated using the direct evaluation. <br>
Here we define the Gaussian rule with respect to what is present in the figure below, then for each value of Œæ and Œ∑  we calculate the Ni to build the vector N, so we can calculate the average nodal stress. Finally, we only write the data from the stress in the x direction using the *gmsh_post.py* file. <br>

#### ‚ñ™ Discuss of the results
In order to better distribute the load we used in the part I (1000kN) in the natural nodes, what was learned was used in classes where they told us how to create the quad4_line_load function (which can be seen in detail in the quad4.py file).
Basically what was done was to take the applied load between two nodes of the natural edge and distribute it with respect to the following equation
<br>
<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\delta&space;W{int}^{e}&space;=&space;\delta&space;u^{e}&space;*&space;fe" title="\delta W{int}^{e} = \delta u^{e} * fe" />
<br>
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?fe&space;=&space;\frac{eL}{2}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}&space;tx\\&space;ty&space;\\&space;tx&space;\\&space;ty&space;\end{bmatrix}" title="fe = \frac{eL}{2}\cdot\begin{bmatrix} tx\\ ty \\ tx \\ ty \end{bmatrix}" />
<br>
Where e is the thickness at the natural edge, tx and tx correspond to the respective loads distributed over the length of the element. In this case ty is 0 and tx is the 1000 kN load divided by 4 times the thickness.

### Quad9

This method works in the same way as quad 4 but here 9 nodes are considered within the element, that is, the gmsh mesh will contain more precise information since the elements have more nodes. It behaves as an iso parametric element defined by the equations below.
<br>
<br>
![img](https://github.com/vjguzman/FE202110-HOMEWORK3/blob/main/Geometria/Quad9%20-%20Eq.png)
<br>
<br>
Using the geometry shown above, we implement Implement the 9-node quadrilateral (Quad9) element and nodal stress averaging for that element based on what has been done for the quad4. <br>
To demonstrate its operation 3 coarses where created, whith simple, medium and fine meshesfor the Quad4 and Quad9 discretizations with similar number of nodes for each case. So we implement a element size factor with 0.25 (9494 nodes), 0.75 (1610 nodes) and 1.25 (762 nodes). We also compared the stress fields for each discretization, using a plot the maximum absolute stress components vs the mesh size (h), said results are shown in the next section. <br>
<br>

### Gauss Rule and Shape Function
The Gauss rule for quad9 is different from the one we used in quad4, because we now have more nodes in the element and more shape functions. We also had to change the shape functions (matrix N with Ni, i=(0,8)), this was reviewed in a certain part in class and working with the shape_function.py code where we use sympy to be able to compute the dNi_dxi, dNi_dyi, dx_dxi, dx_dxdeta, dy_dxi and dy_dxdeta without errors. <br>
In the figure above we have the quad4 and quad9 gauss rule, but as we saw previously the interpolation functions are in a different order so we had to arrange the gauss rule to fit our order.
